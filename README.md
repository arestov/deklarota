Deklaro-ta is JavaScript **Functional Relational Reactive Framework** to create apps with complex logic (offline first, relations).


Tool to **model and manage relations of state and side effects**. It provides **new unique means of expression** to do that.
Means that unlock not just

- correctness, consistency
but also
- performance now and more performance in the future
- relations and data model inspector
- auto-concurrenting of computations (and hints for complex cases)
